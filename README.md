# Shopping Cart

[Check out this project here](https://tidalsana.github.io/shopping-cart/)

## Summary

This project was built for The Odin Project curriculum. We are assigned to replicate a product/shopping website. 
One of the main concepts included React Router DOM where I included different routes to different pages from the Navigation Bar. 
Also incorporates React Library Testing for the DOM. Testing UI elements on the shopping page. 

## Things learned

This section took a little bit to get used to. Routers and Links were a little bit easier to understand, 
but practicing testing in React was a new hurdle. Getting more and more used to React with applying the previous concepts like 
hooks and understanding the lifecycle.
